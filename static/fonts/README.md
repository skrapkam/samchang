Place your font files in this folder.

Recommended:
- Use WOFF2 (smallest, best for modern browsers).
- Optional WOFF fallback if you need older browser support.

Example file name used in the code:
- ToggleFont.woff2

You can rename the file, but if you do, update the @font-face src in `src/styles/reset.tsx` and the preload link in `src/templates/blog-post.js` accordingly.
